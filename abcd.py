The program must accept an integer matrix of size MxM and an integer N representing the size of NxN submatrix as input. The program must print the count of NxN submatrices in the MxM matrix whose border elements are same. Boundary Condition(s): 2 <= M <= 100 2 <= N <= M 1 <= Each integer value <= 1000 Input Format: The first line contains M and N separated by a space. The next M lines contain M integers separated by space(s). Output Format: The first line contains the count of NxN submatrices in the MxM matrix whose border elements are same. Example Input/Output 1: Input: 6 3 8 8 8 9 8 3 8 3 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 3 4 3 7 3 3 3 3 3 7 3 7 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 Output: 4 Explanation: There are four 3x3 submatrices having the same border elements which are highlighted below. 8 8 8 9 8 3 8 3 8 3 3 3 8 8 8 3 4 3 7 3 3 3 3 3 7 3 7 3 3 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 Example Input/Output 2: Input: 4 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 Output: 3
